# S&P 500 Price Prediction with Machine Learning

This project uses historical data from the S&P 500 index to build a predictive model for future prices. The goal is to develop a model that avoids common overfitting pitfalls and performs well in real-world scenarios. We use the yfinance package to source financial data and apply machine learning techniques—particularly a random forest regressor—for price prediction.

## The project walks through:

- Downloading and preprocessing financial data
- Feature engineering with lagged variables and technical indicators
- Backtesting to simulate real-time predictions
- Improving the model with additional predictors
- Strategies for avoiding overfitting

## Tools and Technologies

- Python 3
- yfinance
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (optional, for visualizations)

## Model Workflow

1. **Data Download**: Fetch S&P 500 data using `yfinance`
2. **Data Cleaning**: Prepare the dataset using pandas
3. **Feature Engineering**: Add lag features and rolling statistics
4. **Model Training**: Use Random Forest to learn from historical patterns
5. **Backtesting**: Simulate predictions as if running in real-time
6. **Improvements**: Add more predictors and tune hyperparameters

## Next Steps

- Add alternative data (e.g., sentiment, macroeconomic indicators)
- Experiment with LSTM or Transformer-based models
- Deploy model predictions to a dashboard or live notebook
